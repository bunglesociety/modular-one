# Regression suite (tests/regress.c, tests/target_budget.py; details at the top of regress.c):
#   golden renders  every engine x preset, the drum kit, voice modes, FX sends, a 4-track mix: one hash

#   health          clipping, DC, peak level, voices free after the release, silence at the end.
#   CPU             instructions / sample per preset and mix (tests/cpu_baseline.txt, +25 %), ns printed;
#                   target: loop instructions of the render functions in build/felucca.dis
#                   (tests/target_budget.txt, +10 %; exact, static).
#   voices          the budget of 8, steal fades, MONO / LEGATO / UNISON keep their note, the VOICE cap,
#                   no hanging notes on any MIDI / key routing.
# After an intended change of the sound: GOLDEN_UPDATE=1 sh tests/run_tests.sh, review the diff
# of tests/golden.txt, commit it with the change. After an intended change of the cost (or a new
# compiler): BUDGET_UPDATE=1 (rewrites cpu_baseline.txt and target_budget.txt). VERBOSE=1: every render.
